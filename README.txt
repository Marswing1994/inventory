	The design strategy for the Thread ‘n things website is based around separation of concerns. This site utilizes partials to break up the html code into smaller, more manageable pieces. This will ultimately reduce strain on the browser and ensure consistency across the site if it were to grow in the future. The partials are written once and then linked across any page that may need them. The three main partials included in this suite of web pages are the head partial, the menu partial, and the footer partial. If any changed would be needed in the future, the use of partials allows us to update the partial file once and immediately implement a change across every page that references the partial. This also makes the actual page html files more readable, as large chunks of code are able to be reduced to one single call line.
	
	The pages for the site are all linked together by utilizing routes. Routes work with the Express server. Express is built as a web application framework specifically for Node.js, and allows a developer to structure a web application more efficiently. The Express server was installed and utilized to configure the routes between the website pages. Each route calls to a path for the page it needs in the /views folder. If the called page is found, the application will use a handler to execute a function that pulls up the page for the user. The links to the routes are referenced inside the menu partial file. Each link is called using a forward slash and the page name. Forward slash alone is used to call the index page.
